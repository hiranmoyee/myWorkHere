    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Tezpur University, Assam, in 2022. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc IT) from Jorhat Institute of Science & Technology, Assam, completed in 2019. My academic journey began with 10 + 2 from Sibsagar Govt. H.S. & M.P. School in 2016 and high school from Patkai Shankardev Shishu Vidya Niketan in 2014.
    With over 1 year and 6 months of professional experience as a Project Associate at IIT Guwahati, I have honed my skills in data engineering and web development. My role involved contributing to the development of Vishleshakee 2, a unified platform for social media content analytics, utilizing technologies such as Cassandra and Elasticsearch (Elassandra). I collaborated on projects funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.
    I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript, and have hands-on experience with web development frameworks like Laravel and Django. My interest lies in exploring emerging technologies and contributing to open-source projects. I am passionate about continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in technology, particularly in data engineering, artificial intelligence, and big data.</p>
